\begin{theorem}
	Let \(G = \left<X : R \right> \) and \(H = \left<X : R^{\prime} \right> \)  be groups generated by \(X\) following relations \(R\) and \(R^{\prime}\) . Suppose all generators for \(H\) satisfy all defining relations for \(G\). That is, \(R\) is a subset of \(R^{\prime}\). Then, we find \(H\) is a homomorphic image of \(G\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Recall \(G = F\left( X \right)  / N\)  where \(N\) is the normal closure of \(R\) in \(F\left( X \right) \) and \(H = F\left( X \right)  / N^{\prime}\)  where \(N^{\prime}\)  is the normal closure of \(R^{\prime}\) in \(F\left( X \right) \) . But, since all relations on \(R\) are satisfied by \(H\) , we have \(N \le N^{\prime}\) .  Then, since \(F\left( X \right)  / N^{\prime} = \left( F\left( X \right) / N \right) / \left( N^{\prime} / N \right) = G / \left( N^{\prime} / N \right) \), hence \(H\) is a homomorphic image of \(G\).
\end{proof}
