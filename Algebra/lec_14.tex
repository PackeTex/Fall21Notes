Let \(G\) be a group, and \(Z_0 \left( G \right)  = \{1\} \) with \(Z_1 \left( G \right)  = Z\left( G \right) \). Thus, \( G / Z_1\left( G \right) \) is a group which has \(Z\left( G / Z_1\left( G \right)  \right)  = \frac{Z_2 \left( G \right) }{Z_1 \left( G \right) }\) where \(Z_2\left( G \right) \) is the preimage of \( G  / Z_1\left( G \right) \), that being the subgroup of \(G\) containing \(Z_1 \left( G \right) \). We see we may continue
