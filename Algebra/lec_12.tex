\begin{recall}
	We showed that for a finite group \(G\) we could exploit the number of sylow \(p\)-groups, \(n_{p}\) to set up a congruence system with the only solution being \(n_{p} = 1\) for some \(p\), hence \(G\) was not simple (as \(n_{p} = 1\) guarantees the corersponding \(p\)-group to be normal). Failing this, we found we could assume a sylow \(p\)-group of order \(p\) had only trivial intersection to attain a lower bound on the size of the group which was larger than \(\left| G \right| \), implying once again that \(n_{p} =1\), so \(G\) was not normal.
