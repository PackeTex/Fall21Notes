\begin{definition}[Polynomial Ring]
	Let \(R\) be a commutative ring and we define \(R\left[ X \right] \) to be the ring of polynomials in the variable \(x\) with coefficients from \(R\) defined as follows.\\
	An element \(f \in R\left[ X \right] \) has the form \[
	f = a_0 + a_1x + \ldots + a_{n} x^{n}
	\] for some \(n \ge 0\) and each \(a_{i} \in R\). This is a formal sum in the sense that two polynomials
	\begin{align*}
		f &=aa00 +aa11x + \ldots + a_{n}x^{n}\\
	.\end{align*}
\end{definition}
