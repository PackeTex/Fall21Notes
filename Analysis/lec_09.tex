\begin{definition}
	Let \(S \subseteq \R\) and \(f : S \to \overline{\R}\). Then, we say \(f\) is continuous at \(x_0 \in S\) if \(H \circ f\) is continuous at \(x_0\) on \(S\) for any extending function \(H\). Similarity, we say \(f\) is continuous on \(S\) if \(H \circ f\) is continuous on \(S\) for any extending function \(H\).\\
	Furthermore, we say \(f\) is (strictly) increasing/decreasing/monotone if \(H \circ f\) is (strictly) increasing/decreasing/monotone.\\
	Again, if \(\left( f_{n} \right) \) is a series of functions \(f_{n} : S \to \overline{\R}\), we say \(\left( f_{n} \right) \) converges pointwise/uniformly to \(f:S \to \overline{\R}\) if \(\left( H \circ f_{n} \right) \) converges pointwise/uniformly to \(H \circ f\) for any extending function \(H\).
