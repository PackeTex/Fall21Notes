This is my notes for my classes at Uni of Memphis in Fall 21. In order to compile a custom set of lectures, simply clone the repository and change the full.tex file in one of the classes in order to only contain the lecture notes you want.
Then, simply run 'latexmk --pdflatex -silent -f full.tex' or your favorite latex document builder to get a pdf.
Test.
