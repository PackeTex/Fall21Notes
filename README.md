This is my notes for my classes at Uni of Memphis in Fall 21. In order to compile a custom set of lectures, simply clone the repository and change the full.tex file in one of the classes in order to only contain the lecture notes you want.
Then, simply run 'latexmk --pdflatex -silent -f full.tex' in terminal/cmd or your favorite latex document builder to get a pdf.
To view or download the pdf's, pick a class folder and open/download full.pdf for all lectures so far or master.pdf for the last 2 lectures.
